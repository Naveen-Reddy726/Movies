    <h2>THE BOYZ</h2>
    <p>"The Boys" is a popular and critically acclaimed superhero media franchise, best known for its live-action <br>
        television series on Prime Video, which deconstructs the superhero genre with a dark, satirical, <br>
        and R-rated take. The franchise is based on the comic book series of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. </p>

        <p>The main story follows a group of vigilantes, informally known as "The Boys," led by Billy Butcher, as they <br>
            fight against corrupt and often arrogant superheroes (or "Supes") who abuse their powers and celebrity status.<br>
             Most of the Supes work for a powerful and marketing-obsessed corporation called Vought International.<br>
              The primary adversaries for The Boys are Vought's premier superhero team, "The Seven,<br>
              " led by the narcissistic and unstable Homelander. </p>
